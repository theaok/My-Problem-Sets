// Jameson Colbert, Data Mgmt, PS3 REVISED, 24 February 2021 (rev. 3 March 2021)

/* 
For this problem set, I merged COVID data with NJ census data, NJ poverty data 
(both raw poverty numbers and percentages), NJ unemployment data, data on contaminated 
sites in NJ counties, and rates of 
uninsurance. My hypothesis would be that counties with greater poverty rates and signs
of socioeconomic distress (unemployment and lack of health insurance)
would see higher mean deaths/cases from COVID. After the merge, I am noticing some 
correlation //good--but have code for it!


between poverty rates and pandemic deaths, however this can be attr-
ibuted to population and population density. An example would be Bergen County,
a wealthy suburb of New York with low poverty rate but high mean cases and 
deaths from COVID. It is New Jersey's most populated county with nearly 1 million
residents. Another example is Cumberland county, one of NJ's poorest but least 
populated counties. It has a low mean case and death rate.
Future research should include population density numbers by county as
well as information on health rankings by county.

fine; but could do it now, the more data the merrier

3 March and 4 March Revisions:
nice, very helpful to keep a log like that

For this revision, I most importantly imported data as I directly found it
online, without cleaning it up beforehand in excel. I also downloaded some data 
from New York University in order to perform a reshape. I was thinking about 
using the uncollapsed Covid data for a reshape since it is data over time, but
I didn't think it would work so I just used new data for now. 
NOTE: For the NJContamSites, I kept that the same. The original dataset was an
excel sheet listing contaminated sites by municipality (it's linked below), and 
I had doubts I could effectively clean it up in Stata.
All data is from 2019, with the exception of COVID data which spans 2020 and 2021,
as well as contam sites data which includes active sites and the 
countyhealthrankings.org data, which is from 2020.
