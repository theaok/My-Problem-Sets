// MERGING

//could say a bit more about rationale, research questions, hypotheses etc
/* For this problem set, I merged COVID data with NJ census data, in an effort to see how NJ looked when it came to COVID. 
The merging was successful and allowed me to look at NJ county COVID data along with population numbers. Will be useful for my later PS, such as those including poverty numbers. 
Also ran generating, encoding, recoding, replacing, collapsing, drop, bys, and egen */
