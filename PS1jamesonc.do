//let's analyze by class?
tab class (bible)
// the working and middle classes have the most overall representation,
// so while it seems they are the most likely to believe the bible is the word
// of god (326 working class believe so vs only 93 of the lower class) we
// must consider proportion
// 93 lower class believe bible is word of god (WoG). there are 208 total lower
// class obsvs. 93 div by 208 is roughly .45
// 326 working class believe bible is WoG. there are 1,010 total working class
// obsvs. 326 div by 1,010 is roughly .33.
// thus, a higher proportion of the lower class believes that the bible is god's
